        <q><b>Covid second wave was the toughest time in a doctor’s life</b></q>
        <p>The coronavirus disease (<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>) pandemic, which originated in the city of Wuhan, China, has quickly spread to various countries, with many cases having been reported worldwide. As of May 8, 2020, in India, 56,342 positive cases were reported. India, with a population of more than 1.34 billion and the second largest population in the world, will have difficulty in controlling the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among its population</p>
        <p>
            As the healthcare infrastructure got overwhelmed by sheer number of COVID patients, the professional resilience, the courage, and devotion to duty, which the frontline healthcare workers demonstrated was exemplary. By the third week of April, the shortage of beds in the city resulted in only the sickest COVID patients with increasing oxygen requirements being admitted to hospitals. More doctors and nurses were deployed to COVID wards and the treatment of non-COVID diseases practically stopped apart from emergencies. The Emergency Department of many hospitals became like a war zone; overfull with patients on stretchers requiring oxygen support and with ambulances standing outside with deteriorating patients, and unfortunately shortage of high dependency oxygen beds. The nurses and doctors in emergency were frantically rushing around giving care to all including the ones in ambulances outside, trying to segregate COVID from non-COVID patients, making sure all protection protocols were also maintained to prevent spread and still treat extremely distressed patient promptly, comfort extremely concerned relatives, deal with irate relatives of patients while trying to create beds and to make assessment and prioritise admission of the neediest. And all this was performed while wearing full PPE for sometimes 12-hours at a stretch in which one feels very uncomfortable as cannot even go to the bathroom or drink water. The COVID wards were no different, limited number of ICU and ventilator beds needed prioritization, shifting of deteriorating patients from HDU beds to ICU. As all patients were sick the decision of who was sickest of the sicker was not easy and weighed heavily on each doctor’s mind. While being concerned and saddened many times that a deteriorating patient may succumb, every doctor continued to fight for patients’ lives giving the highest level of critical care expertise, providing confidence, comfort and hope to all.</p>

            <p>The second wave of COVID came like a Tsunami and caught us all unaware. As doctors who had been managing COVID patients from the first wave in 2020, and who had kept abreast with the latest developments regarding the virus, the viciousness of the infectivity and steepness of rise in cases was shocking. Within a short period of first two weeks of April, Delhi and many parts of the country were engulfed in a medical and social nightmare that I have not witnessed in my 45-years of medical career and pray that I do not ever see it again. - <b>Dr-Ashok-Seth</b></p>

            <p>In this second wave of COVID more than 800-doctors lost their lives due to COVID in the line of duty in the service of their country and its people. Our respect and prayers for them as they sacrificed their lives so that other could live.</p>
            <p>To honour their sacrifice and efforts during these drastic times let us all take a moment to pay tribute to all the doctors who died during these though times </p>

            <p>Thankfully, due to the timely efforts of policy experts and Government, the second wave has passed but the threat of third wave looms. To fight the third wave, we must understand the emotional exhaustion left behind by the second wave on the doctors and nurses. It is saddening that amid all this we also had multiple reports of assault on healthcare workers where grieved relatives take their anger out on the doctors. It is not just saddening but is deplorable and not acceptable. Strict laws to prevent violence against doctors need to be framed and implemented. Doctors are our most important resource in our fight against COVID, we need to appreciate their commitment, respect their sacrifices, boost their morale, and care for their emotions. As a Society, this is one of the most important steps we can take to be together in this fight against COVID and to win.</p>
